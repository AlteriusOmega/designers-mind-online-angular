OK SO!

Need to decide on system of syncing Firestore database and Firebase Storage image files for products.

Deciding to use paths. Each product will have a folder in Storage. That folder name will be stored as a field in each product document in Firestore.

Then, in the code you will have the product document, you get the folder name, you build the path, and then get the reference using ref(fullPath)

Then, with the image file reference you get the URL via getDownloadURL()


Need to decide where to break up document objects.
For now let's be lazy and always pass the full DocumentData object to any function that needs it. The function will consume the object and get the needed properties

Notes on Firebase API types etc.
When you get a document from Firestire, the type is DocumentData, which is an object with unkown fields
You can get a reference to a file or folder form Storage synchronously, but to get the actual file requires async/await or promises and .then

To deploy (build production) just go in terminal in the root folder and do "firebase deploy". If it doesn't work try "firebase logout" then "firebase login"
